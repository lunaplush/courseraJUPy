    "In information retrieval, precision is a measure of result relevancy, while\n",
    "recall is a measure of how many truly relevant results are returned. A high\n",
    "area under the curve represents both high recall and high precision, where high\n",
    "precision relates to a low false positive rate, and high recall relates to a\n",
    "low false negative rate. High scores for both show that the classifier is\n",
    "returning accurate results (high precision), as well as returning a majority of\n",
    "all positive results (high recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "A system with high recall but low precision returns many results, but most of\n",
    "its predicted labels are incorrect when compared to the training labels. A\n",
    "system with high precision but low recall is just the opposite, returning very\n",
    "few results, but most of its predicted labels are correct when compared to the\n",
    "training labels. An ideal system with high precision and high recall will\n",
    "return many results, with all results labeled correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision ($P`) is defined as the number of true positives (:math:`T_p$)\n",
    "over the number of true positives plus the number of false positives\n",
    "($F_p$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$P = \\frac{T_p}{T_p+F_p}$\n",

    "Recall ($R`) is defined as the number of true positives (:math:`T_p$)\n",
    "over the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives\n",

    "It is important to note that the precision may not decrease with recall. The\n",

    "the threshold of a classifier may increase the denominator, by increasing the\n",
    "number of results returned. If the threshold was previously set too high, the\n",
    "new results may all be true positives, which will increase precision. If the\n",

    "The relationship between recall and precision can be observed in the\n",
    "stairstep area of the plot - at the edges of these steps a small change\n",
